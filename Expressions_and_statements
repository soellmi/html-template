//EXPRESSIONS AND STATEMENTS

//Expression - a (small) piece of code that will produces a value
//3+4 is an expression because it produces a value
//1992 is also an expressions
//true & false are also an expression because it produces a boolean value

//Statement - a bigger piece of code that does not produce a value. 
//(You can think about a statemnet as a sentence and expressions as words)

//We write code as a sequence of actions and those actions are statements.
//for example if/else statements
if (23>10){
    const str ="23 is bigger";
}

//--> the hole if/else block is a statement it does not produce an actual value
// --> but the the string "23 is bigger" is an expression and produces a value
//IMPORTANT FOR NOW: expressions exists, expressions produces values and statements translate actions. 
//Whenever something ends with a semicolon it is a statement

//In template literals you can put expressions, you cannot put statements
console.log(`I'm ${2021-1985} years old`);

//this won't work because it's a statement. If.. won't work because it's a statement.
console.log(`I'm ${2021-1985} years old ${if (23>10)}`)

//FUNCTION DECLARATION AND EXPRESSSION
//FUNCTION DECLARATION: When you create a function with a name.
//We can call it before it's defined in the code.
//FUNCTION EXPRESSION: Here they name may be omitted making the function "anonymous"

//In JavaScript functions are just values and if it's a value we can store it in a variable.

//FUNCTION DECLARATION
//HOISTING allows the functions to be used in the code before they are declared.
//Function declarations are hoisted.
//General way of thinking about how execuation contexts wirj in JS

hoisted();//gives the right output without giving an error

function hoisted(){
    console.log("This is hoisted");
}

//FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS
console.log(notHoisted)

notHoisted();

const notHoisted = function{
    console.log("This is not hoisted")
};

//When something is hoisted you can call for it before you declare it

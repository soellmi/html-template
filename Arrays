//ARRAYS

//We don't want to do it like this we want to store it in one place
//const dog1 ="Tore";
//const dog2 ="Clementine";
//const dog3 ="Doris";

//an array is kind of like a big container where we can store stuff if we have more than one value
//--> an array of strings

//const years = [1985, 1990, 1994]
//console.log(years);

const dogs = ["Tore", "Celemtine", "Doris"]
//console.log(dogs);

//Arrays ALWAYS start with zero!!!
//console.log(dogs[2]);

//This will give us the exact number of elements in the array
//console.log(dogs.length);

//console.log(dogs[dogs.length - 1]);
//useful when working with big data and arrays when you don't know how many elements it contains

//It's possible to mutate arrays
dogs[0] = "Trasan"
//console.log(dogs)

//Arrays can hold different data types and values
const dogName ="Tore";

//console.log(tore);

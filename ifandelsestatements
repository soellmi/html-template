//TAKING DECISIONS - IF/ELSE

//First we define our problem/task
//Then we break it apart into smaller pieces/tasks

//Task: Check if the person is old enough to get their driver's license
// 1. First we need a variable to store the age of the person.
// 2. We need a value to store in a variable will represent the required age to get a driver's license. 
// 3. We need to compare the person's the age against the required age. 
// 4. We need to make a decision based on the evaluation, true or false.

const age = 12;
//person's age is 19

//const requiredAge = 18; (not really need it the one below is better)
//requiered age for getting a driver's license

const isOfAge =age >= 18;
//compare the person's age against the required age

//Here wee took the decision:
//Condition in brackets
//Code in curly brackets
//if(isOfAge) {
    //console.log ("YAY you can get a driver's licens")}
//} else {console.log ("Sorry, come back in a few years")}

//We don't have to store the condition in a variable we can also do it directly in the statement
if (age >= 18) {console.log ("YAY you can get a driver's licens")
} else {
    const yearsLeft = 18-age;
    console.log (`Sorry you are too young. Wait another ${yearsLeft} years`)
}

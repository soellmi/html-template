//INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONS
//Are for storing pieces of code
function logFunction(){
    console.log("This is a function");
}
//defines the function

//logFunction();
//calling for the function to execute

//A function is kind of like a machine where you can put in ingredients and get a finished product. 
//Let's say we want to take a really simple chocolate cake with these three ingredients
//Butter, chocolate and eggs

function chocolateCake(butter, chocolate, eggs){
    const cake = `A simple cake with ${butter} cups of butter ${chocolate} cup of chocolate and ${eggs} eggs`;
    return cake;
}
//Defined the function

//cake does not exist here

chocolateCake(1, 2, 3);
//We need to store the result of the function in a variable
//Declared a variable and assigned it to the function
const yummyCake = chocolateCake(1, 2, 3);
console.log(yummyCake)

//The variables of the parameters are called arguments

function calcAge(age1, age2){ //Declare the function, name it, put in paramters (sometimes)
    const resAge=age1+age2 //Stored them in a new variable
    return resAge; //If we don't return it we won't have access to it
}

console.log(calcAge(20, 10))//We called for the function in the function log (but you can also store it in a variale first)

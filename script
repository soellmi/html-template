// mathematical operators

//const myAge = 2021 - 1985;
//console.log(myAge)

//const brothersAge = 2021 - 1991;

//assignment operator and the most straightforward one is =

let x = 10 + 5;
//console.log(x)

x +=10;
//x = x + 10 reassigning x value as x is 25 (so right now x holds the value of 25)
//console.log(x);

x *= 4;
// x = x *4 =100 (so right now x holds the value of 100)
//console.log(x);

x++;
// plus operator - it increases the value by 1
//console.log(x)

x--;
// minus operator - it decreases the value by 1
//console.log(x)

//Comparison operators
//console.log(myAge > brothersAge);

// checking if my age is greater than my brother's
//console.log(brothersAge >=18);
//greater or equal

const isFullAge = brothersAge >=18;
//the variable isFullAge will be holding the boolean value 
//console.log(isFullAge);

//console.log(now - 1991 > now - 1985);
//How does JavaScript know what to do first? Does the calculation before it does the comparison

const hasDriversLicense =true;

const hasGoodVision = true;

//A and B variables

//console.log(hasDriversLicense && hasGoodVision)
//&& this is the and operator
//both values needs to be true for the operation to return true
//console.log(hasDriversLicense || hasGoodVision)
//|| this is the or operator
//only one needs to be true for the operation to return true

//console.log(!hasDriversLicense);
// '!' = this is the not operator

const canDrive = hasDriversLicense && hasGoodVision;
//console.log(canDrive);

//Array below
const helenaArray=["Helena", "Johansson, 2022-1985" , "developer"]

//If we want to create an object we do so by using {}
//Objects are one of the fundamental things in JavaScript
//The advantage with using objects is that it doesn't matter in what order we access them
const helenaObject={
    firstName: "Helena",
    lastName: "Johansson",
    age: 2022-1985,
    job: "developer",
}
//The above object hold four properties and we can add values to the properties

//So how do we get data from an object?
//console.log(helenaObject)

//To get a specific property there are two ways
//We should use the .notation 
//console.log(helenaObject.firstName)

//We can use the bracket notation but it is very rarely used
//console.log(helenaObject["firstName"])

//We can put expressions in the [] notation but not in the.notation
//However, when we are working with modern frameworks you don't really have to use this

const info =prompt(
    "What information do you want to know about Helena? Choose between first name, last name, age or job"
);
//console.log(info);
console.log(helenaObject.info);
//Here we are trying to access a prompt that doesn't exist
console.log(helenaObject[info])
//We will rarely have to work in the above way [bracket notation] since we are going to use modern frameworks

//Below is how to handle an error
if (helenaObject[info]){
    console.log(helenaObject[info]);
} else{
    console.log ("Sorry, wrong input");
}
*/

//console.log(helenaObject)

//This is how you put more properties onto the object
//. notation

//helenaObject.location="Falk√∂ping";
//[]notation
//helenaObject["website"]="klarr.se";
//console.log(helenaObject);

//Small challenge for you!
//Write a sentence in a dynamic way. Do not hardcode any of the information. 
//YOu should call for the object and then the property of that object that hold the information you want to put in a sentence.
//Hint: use one array, if you want to get the number of dogs you need to use multiple dots. 

//'This' keyword
